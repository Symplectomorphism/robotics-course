* The bottom-right corner is the origin of the world frame $\{0\}$.
* The map is of a $2$m-by-$2$m room, with separators (walls) of thickness $\delta =
0.01\,\text{m} = 1\,\text{cm}$.
* The two corridors have width $\varepsilon = 0.3\,\text{m} = 30\,\text{cm}$.
  - Each corridor have a clearance of $\frac{1}{2}\,$m from the walls they face.
  - The width of the corridors fits $1.5$ autonomous ground vehicles.
* The map is static and is known by the robot.
