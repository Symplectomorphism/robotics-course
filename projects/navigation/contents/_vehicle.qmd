* The autonomous ground vehicle has a circular frame
  - The radius of the circular frame is $r = 0.1$m.
* The pose of the vehicle w.r.t. the world $\{0\}$ is below figure. 
  - $\theta$: angle the axis $x_r$ makes with the axis $x_0$.
  - $(x, y)$: components of the vector that connects the origins of
    frames $\{0\}$ and $\{R\}$ starting from $\{0\}$, resolved in frame $\{0\}$.

$$ {\xi}_R \sim {^0}\bm{T}_R = \begin{pmatrix} \cos{\theta} & -\sin{\theta} & x
\\ \sin{\theta} & \cos{\theta} & y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}. $$

* The translational velocity $v$ of the vehicle is purely along the $x-$ axis.
* The angular velocity of $\omega$ of the vehicle is purely along the $z-$ axis.
* Thinking of $v$ and $\omega$ as the inputs to the system, its kinematics is
given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} &= v \cos{\theta}, \\
\dot{y} &= v \sin{\theta}, \\
\dot{\theta} &= \omega.
\end{aligned}
$$
