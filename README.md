# robotics-course

This repository contains the slide decks for the Robotics course at Boise State.

* The presentations are supposed to be viewed in Firefox.
  * Chrome does not support MathML, therefore, will not render the math properly.
* Install the regular [Fira Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans).
* Go to the slide deck's folder-> docs and run ''index.html'' in Firefox.
