* They provide a means to fuse multiple independent noisy measurements of the
same signal that have complementary spectral characteristics.
  - $\mu_1$: predominantly high frequency noise
  - $\mu_2$: predominantly low frequency disturbance
* Choose a pair of complementary transfer functions $$ F_1(s) + F_2(s) = 1 $$
  - $F_1(s)$: low-pass transfer function
  - $F_2(s)$: high-pass transfer function

* The filtered estimate is given by 
$$ \hat{X}(s) = F_1(s)Y_1 + F_2(s)Y_2 = X(s) + F_1(s)\mu_1(s) + F_2(s)\mu_2(s).
$$

* This type of filter is also known as _distorsionless filtering_ since the
signal $x(t)$ is not distorted by the filter.

* Complementary filters are particularly well suited to fusing low bandwidth
position measurements with high bandwidth rate measurements for first-order
kinematic systems $$ \dot{x} = u $$ with typical measurement characteristics 
$$ y_x = L(s)x + \mu_x, \qquad y_u = u + \mu_u + b(t) $$
  - $L(s)$: low-pass filter associated with sensor characteristics,
  - $\mu$: noise in both measurements,
  - $b(t)$ is a deterministic perturbation dominated by low-frequency content.
* $L(s) \approx 1$ over frequency range on which the measurement $y_x$ is of interest.
* The rate measurement is integrated: $\frac{y_u}{s}$ to obtain an estimate of
the state and the noise and bias characteristics of the signal are dominantly
low frequency effects.
* Now, choose:
$$ F_1(s) = \frac{C(s)}{C(s) + s}, \qquad F_2(s) = 1 - F_1(s) = \frac{s}{C(s) +
s} $$ 
  - $C(s)$: all pass such that $L(s)F_1(s) \approx 1$ over the bandwidth of
    $L(s)$. Then 
$$ \hat{X}(s) \approx X(s) + F_1(s)\mu_x(s) + \frac{\mu_u(s) + b(s)}{C(s) +
s}. $$

* The filter structure is implemented by exploiting the complementary
sensitivity structure of a linear feedback system subject to load disturbance.

$$ \hat{x}(s) = \frac{C(s)}{s + C(s)} y_x(s) + \frac{s}{C(s) + s}
\frac{y_u(s)}{s} = T(s)y_x(s) + S(s)\frac{y_u(s)}{s} $$ where $S(s)$ is the
sensitivity function of the closed-loop system and $T(s)$ is the complementary
sensitivity.

* Simplest choice for feedback: $C(s) = k_p$. In this case, the CL-dynamics of
the filter are given by
$$ \dot{\hat{x}} = y_u + k_p(y_x - \hat{x}). $$

* Associated complementary filters associated with this choice are 
$$F_1(s) = \frac{k_p}{s+k_p}, \quad \text{ and } \quad  F_2(s) = \frac{s}{s + k_p}. $$

* If the rate measurement bias, $b(t) = b_0$, is a constant then it is natural
to add an integrator to the compensator to make the system type I 
$$ C(s) = k_p + \frac{k_i}{s}. $$

* A type I system will reject the constant load disturbance $b_0$ from the
output. 

* The resulting dynamics are 
$$ \dot{\hat{x}} = y_u - \hat{b} + k(y_x - \hat{x}), \qquad \dot{\hat{b}} =
-k_i(y_x - \hat{x}). $$

* Consider the Lyapunov function candidate 
$$ \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} \lvert x - \hat{x}\rvert^2 + \frac{1}{2k_i}\lvert b_0 - \hat{b} \rvert^2. $$

  - Abusing the notation for the noise processes and using $\tilde{x} = x -
    \hat{x}$ and $\tilde{b} = b_0 - \hat{b}$, one has
$$ \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t} \mathcal{L} = -k_p \lvert \tilde{x} \rvert^2 -
\mu_u \tilde{x} + \mu_x \left( \tilde{b} - k \tilde{x} \right). $$

* In the absence of noise, one may apply Lyapunov's direct method to prove
convergence of the state estimate.
  - LaSalle's invariance principle may be used to show that $\hat{b} \rightarrow
    b_0$.
  - When the underlying system is linear, the linear form of the feedback and
    adaptation law ensure that the CL system is linear and stability implies
    exponential stability.
