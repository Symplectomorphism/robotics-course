## Transforming wrenches (forces and torques) {.smaller}

&nbsp;

* The twist is a vector quantity that represents translational and rotational 
velocity.

* In a similar fashion, we can combine translational force and rotational torque 
into a $6$-vector that is called a _wrench_ $\bm{W} = \left(f_x, f_y, f_z, m_x,
m_y, m_z\right) \in \mathbb{R}^6$.

* A wrench ${^B}\bm{W}$ is defined w.r.t. the coordinate frame $\{B\}$ and
applied at the origin of that frame.

* A wrench ${^C}\bm{W}$ is equivalent if it causes the same motion of the body
when applied to the origin of the coordinate frame $\{C\}$ and defined w.r.t. 
$\{C\}$. The wrenches are related by
$$
{^C}\bm{W} = \begin{bmatrix}
{^B}\bm{R}_C & {^B}\hat{\bm{t}}_C \; {^B}\bm{R}_C \\ \bm{0}_{3 \times 3} & 
{^B}\bm{R}_C
\end{bmatrix}^\top =
\text{Ad}_{{^B}\bm{T}_C}^\top {^B}\bm{W},
$$
which is similar to the transformation of twists, but uses the transpose of the
adjoint of the _inverse_ relative pose!
