# Accelerating Bodies and Reference Frames

## Dynamics of moving bodies {.smaller}

* For translational motion, Newton's second law describes, in the inertial
frame, the acceleration of a particle with position $x$ and mass $m$ due to the 
applied force $\bm{f}$:

$$ m {^0}\ddot{\bm{x}} = {^0}\bm{f}. $$ 

* Rotational motion in $\bm{SO}(3)$ is described by Euler's equations of motion 
which relates the angular acceleration of the body in the body frame to the 
applied torque $\bm{\tau}$ and a positive-definite rotational inertia matrix 
${^B}\bm{J}$ (notice that this is frame-dependent!)

$$ {^B}\bm{J} \; {^B} \dot{\bm{\omega}} + \bm{\omega} \times \left( {^B}\bm{J}
\; \bm{\omega} \right) = {^B} \bm{\tau}. $$

* Nonzero angular acceleration implies that angular velocity, the axis and/or 
the angle of rotation, evolves over time.
