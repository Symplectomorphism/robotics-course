Bias that varies over time is often called sensor drift. Both the scale factor and the bias are typically functions of temperature.\n\nIn practice, bias is the biggest problem because it varies with time and temperature and has a very deleterious effect on the estimated pose and position."

Here we will consider a simple, but still very effective alternative."
