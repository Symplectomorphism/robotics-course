* Omnidirectional wheels remove the nonholonomic constraint, simplifying control
algorithms.
* Such ''Swedish'' wheels comprises a number of rollers set around a
circumference of the wheel with their axes at an angle of $\alpha$ relative to
the axle of the wheel.
* The rollers have a barrel shape so only one point on the roller is in contact
with the ground at any time.
* Rotation of the wheel will cause a forward velocity of $R\omega \bm{x}_W$
where $R$ is the wheel radius.
* Because the roller is free to roll in the direction indicated by the green
line, normal to the roller's axis, there is potentially arbitrary velocity in
that direction.
* Resolve a desired velocity $\bm{v}$ into two components, one parallel to
$\bm{x}_W$ and one parallel to the rolling direction
$$
\begin{aligned}
\bm{v} &= \underbrace{v_W\bm{x}_W}_{\text{driven}} + \underbrace{v_r\left(
\cos{\alpha} \bm{x}_W + \sin{\alpha}\bm{y}_W\right)}_{\text{rolling}} \\ 
&= \left( v_W + v_r \cos{\alpha}\right)\bm{x}_W + v_r \sin{\alpha} \bm{y}_W,
\end{aligned}

* Here $v_W$ is the speed due to wheel rotation and $v_r$ is the rolling speed.
* Hence the required wheel rotation rate is $\omega = \frac{v_W}{R}$.
* A single mecanum wheel does not allow any control in the rolling direction,
but for three or more mecanum wheels, suitably arranged, the motion in the
rolling direction of any one wheel will be driven by the other wheels.
* The four wheel contact points indicated by the _gray dots_ have coordinate
vectors ${^B}\bm{p}_i$. For a desired body velocity ${^B}\bm{v}_B$ and angular
rate ${^B}\omega$ the velocity at each wheel contact point is
$$ {^B}\bm{v}_i = {^B}\bm{v}_B + {^B}\omega \bm{z}_B \times {^B}\bm{p}_i. $$
