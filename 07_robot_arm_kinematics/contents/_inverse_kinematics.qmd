# Inverse Kinematics

## The general inverse kinematics problem {.smaller}

* Given a $4 \times 4$ homogeneous transformation $\bm{H} = \begin{pmatrix} \bm{R} 
& \bm{d} \\ \bm{0} & 1 \end{pmatrix} \in \bm{SE}(3)$, find a solution, or
possibly multiple solutions of the equation 
$$ {^0}\bm{T}_n(q_1, \ldots, q_n) = \bm{A}_1(q_1) \cdots \bm{A}(q_n) = \bm{H}.
$$
* This matrix equation has sixteen scalar equations to be solved for $n$
variables $q_1, \ldots, q_n$.
* Four of these equations are trivial (last row of $\bm{H}$) so the remaining
twelve equations are $$\bm{t}_{ij}(q_1, \ldots, q_n) = \bm{h}_{ij}, \text{  for
} \quad i = 1, 2, 3, \; \; j = 1, 2, 3, 4. $$

* Typically these equations are much too difficult to solve directly in
closed-form.
  - kinematic structure of the manipulator must be exploited to get a closed-form
    solution.

* Unlike the forward kinematics problem, the inverse kinematics problem may or
may not have a solution.
  - Even if a solution exists, it may or may not be unique.
  - Since the forward kinematic equations are in general complicated nonlinear
    functions of the joint variables, the solutions may be difficult to obtain
    even when they do exist.
* Once a solution is identified, it must be further checked to see whether or
not it satisfies all constraints on ther anges of possible joint motions.

## Numerical inverse kinematics {.smaller}

* Let's consider an iterative, numerical algorithms for the computation
of inverse kinematics.
  - They are increasingly popular due to the availability of high-performance
    computation and the advent of open-source software.
  - When closed-form solutions do not exist or if the manipulator is redundant,
    a recourse to numerical methods may be the better option.

* Let $\bm{x}^d \in \mathbb{R}^m$ be a vector of Cartesian coordinates: $\bm{x}^d$ could
represent
  - the wrist center point ($m=3$),
  - the end-effector pose using a minimal representation ($m=6$).
* Let $\bm{f}: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ be the forward kinematics map
for an $n$-link manipulator and set $$ \bm{g}(\bm{q}) = \bm{x}^d - \bm{f}(\bm{q}). $$
  - Then a solution to the inverse kinematics is a configuration $\bm{q}^d$
    satisfying $$ \bm{g}(\bm{q}^d) = \bm{x}^d - \bm{f}(\bm{q}^d) = \bm{0}. $$


## Jacobian inverse method {.smaller}

* We expand the forward kinematics map $\bm{f}(\bm{q})$ in a Taylor series about
a configuration $\bm{q}^d$, such that $\bm{x}^d = \bm{f}(\bm{q}^d)$ to obtain 
$$ \bm{f}(\bm{q}) = \bm{f}(\bm{q}^d) + \bm{J}(\bm{q}^d)(\bm{q} - \bm{q}^d) +
\text{h.o.t.}, $$ where we take $\bm{J} = \bm{J}_a(\bm{q})$ as the analytic
Jacobian.

* Neglecting h.o.t., we have $\bm{q}^d - \bm{q} = \bm{J}^{-1}(\bm{q})
\left(\bm{x}^d - \bm{f}(\bm{q}) \right)$ assuming that the Jacobian is
invertible.

* To find a solution for $\bm{q}^d$, we begin with an initial guess, $\bm{q}_0$
and form a sequence of successive estimates, $\bm{q}_0, \bm{q}_1, \bm{q}_2,
\ldots$, as $$\bm{q}_k = \bm{q}_{k-1} + \alpha_k \bm{J}^{-1} \left(\bm{x}^d -
\bm{f}(\bm{q}_{k-1}) \right), \;\; k= 1,2,\ldots. $$
  - The _step size_ $\alpha_k > 0$ can be adjusted over each iteration to aid convergence.
  - If the Jacobian is not invertible, then one may use the pseudoinverse
    $\bm{J}^\dagger$.
  - For $m \leq n$, we define the right pseudoinverse as 
  $\bm{J}^\dagger \triangleq \bm{J}^\top \left(\bm{J}\bm{J}^\top\right)^{-1}$

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
This equation is based on a first-order approximation of the inverse kinematics
so only local convergence can be expected. 
:::


## Jacobian transpose method {.smaller}

* We define an optimization problem: &nbsp;
$\min_\bm{q} \bm{F}(\bm{q}) = \min_\bm{q} \frac{1}{2}\left( \bm{f}(\bm{q}) -
\bm{x}^d \right)^\top \left( \bm{f}(\bm{q}) - \bm{x}^d \right)$.
* The gradient of the above cost function $\bm{F}(\bm{q})$ is given by: &nbsp;
$\nabla \bm{F}(\bm{q}) = \bm{J}^\top(\bm{q}) \left( \bm{f}(\bm{q}) - \bm{x}^d
\right).$
* A _gradient descent_ algorithm to minimize $\bm{F}(\bm{q})$ is then 
$$\bm{q}_k = \bm{q}_{k-1} - \alpha_k \; \nabla\bm{F}(\bm{q}) = \bm{q}_{k-1} + 
\alpha_k \bm{J}^{\top} \left(\bm{x}^d - \bm{f}(\bm{q}_{k-1}) \right), \;\; 
k= 1,2,\ldots. $$

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Comparison of inverse and transpose methods
* Jacobian transpose is easier to compute than the Jacobian inverse.
* Jacobian transpose does not suffer from configuration singularities.
* The converge of the Jacobian transpose method, in terms of number of
iterations, may be slower than the Jacobian inverse method.
:::


## <span style="font-size: 90%">Example: Jacobian inverse and Jacobian transpose</span> {.smaller}

* Desired end-effector coordinates are $\bm{x}^d = (0.2, 1.3)^\top$.
* The joint variables $\bm{q}^d$ corresponding to $\bm{x}^d$ are $\theta_1^d =
0.5650$, $\theta_2^d = 1.7062$.
* The initial guess is $\theta_1 = 0.25$, $\theta_2 = 0.75$.
* The step size was chosen as $\alpha_k = 0.75$ for all $k$.

## Kinematic decoupling {.smaller}

* For manipulators with three consecutive joint axes
intersecting at a point (e.g. Stanford manip.), it is possible to decouple
the inverse kinematics problem into two simpler problems
  - _inverse position kinematics_,
  - _inverse orientation kinematics_.
* For a six-DoF manipulator with a spherical wrist the inverse kinematics
problem may be separated into two simpler problems:
  - First finding the position of the intersection of the wrist axes (__wrist
    center__),
  - Then finding the orientation of the wrist.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* We express the general inverse kinematics problem as two sets of equations 
representing the rotational and positional kinematics where $\bm{o}$ and
$\bm{R}$ are the desired position and orientation of the tool frame, expressed
w.r.t. $\Sigma_0$.
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
$$
\begin{aligned}
{^0}\bm{R}_6(q_1, \ldots, q_6) &= \bm{R}, \\
{^0}\bm{o}_6(q_1, \ldots, q_6) &= \bm{o}.
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

::::

* We are given $\bm{o}$ and $\bm{R}$ and the inverse kinematics problem is to
solve for $q_1, \ldots, q_6$.
* With a spherical wrist, the axes $\bm{z}_3$, $\bm{z}_4$, and $\bm{z}_5$
intersect at $o_c$ and hence $o_4 = o_5 = o_c$.
* Often $o_3$ will also be at $o_c$ but this is not necessary.



## Kinematic decoupling {.smaller}

* What is _important_ is that the motion of the final three joints will __NOT__
change the position of $o_c$ and thus the position of the wrist center is a
function of only the first three joint variables.

* The origin of the tool frame (whose desired location is given by $\bm{o}$) is
simply obtained by a translation of distance $d_6$ along $\bm{z}_5$ from $o_c$.

* $\bm{z}_5 = \bm{z}_6$ and the third column of $\bm{R}$ expressed the direction
$\bm{z}_6$ w.r.t. $\Sigma_0$. Therefore we have $$ \bm{o} = {^0}\bm{o}_c + d_6 \bm{R} 
\;\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}^\top. $$


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* In order to have the end-effector of the robot at the point with coordinates
given by $\bm{o}$ and with the orientation given by $\bm{R}$, it is necessary
and sufficient that the wrist center $o_c$ have the coordinates
  - and the orientation of the frame $\Sigma_6$ w.r.t. $\Sigma_0$ be given by
    $\bm{R}$.

* If the components of $\bm{o}$ are denoted $o_x$, $o_y$, $o_z$ and the
components of ${^0}\bm{o}_c$ are denoted by $x_c$, $y_c$, $z_c$, then we must
have 
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
$$
{^0}\bm{o}_c = \bm{o} - d^6 \bm{R} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

$$
\begin{pmatrix} x_c \\ y_c \\ z_c \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
o_x - d_6r_{13} \\ o_y - d_6r_{23} \\ o_z - d_6r_{33}
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
:::

::::

* Using this equation, we may find the values of the first three joint
variables.
  - This determines the orientation transformation ${^0}\bm{R}_3$, which depends
    only on these first three joint variables.

&nbsp;


* Now that we have the rotation matrix ${^0}\bm{R}_3$ as a repercussion of the
location of the wrist center $o_c$ from our previous discussion.

* We can now determine the orientation of the end-effector relative to the frame
$\Sigma_3$ from the expression 
$$
\bm{R} = {^0}\bm{R}_3{^3}\bm{R}_6
$$ as 

$$
{^3}\bm{R}_6 = \left({^0}\bm{R}_3\right)^{-1}\bm{R} = \left({^0}\bm{R}_3\right)^\top \bm{R}
$$

* The final three joint angles can then be found as a set of Euler angles
corresponding to ${^3}\bm{R}_6$.

position of the end-effector both w.r.t the base frame.

variables $\theta_4$, $\theta_5$, and $\theta_6$.

## Inverse position: a geometric approach {.smaller}

* Most six-DoF manipulator designs are kinematically simple rendering the
geometric approach simple and effective.
  - It is partly due to the difficulty of the general inverse kinematics
    problem that manipulator designs have evolved to their present state.
* The complexity of the inverse kinematics problem increases with the number of
nonzero DH parameters.
  - For most manipulators, many of the $a_i$, $d_i$ are zero, the $\alpha_i$ are
    $0$ or $\pm \frac{\pi}{2}$, etc.
  - In these cases especially, a geometric approach is simplest and most
    natural.
* The general idea of the geometric approach is to solve for the joint variable
$q_i$ by projecting the manipulator onto the $\bm{x}_{i-1}-\bm{y}_{i-1}$ plane
and solving a simple trigonometry problem.
  - For example, to solve for $\theta_1$, we project the arm onto the
    $\bm{x}_0$-$\bm{y}_0$ plane and use trigonometry to find $\theta_1$.
  - We will illustrate this method with two important examples: the spherical
    (RRP) and the articulated (RRR) arms.


## Spherical configuration {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="62%"}
* Projecting $\bm{o}_c$ onto the $\bm{x}_0-\bm{y}_0$ plane, we see that
$$ \theta_1 = \arctan_2{(y_c, x_c)} \quad \text{or} \quad \theta_1 = \pi +
\arctan_2{(y_c, x_c)}. $$
* These solutions for $\theta_1$ are valid unless $x_c = y_c = 0$, i.e., 
the manipulator is in a <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Singular</span> configuration.
  - In this case $\bm{o}_c \pitchfork \bm{z}_0$ as shown in bottom right.
  - Then any value of $\theta_1$ leaves $\bm{o}_c$ fixed.
* With $r^2 = x_c^2 + y_c^2$ and $s = z_c - d_1$, the angle $\theta_2$ is found 
from the top figure as $$ \theta_2 = \arctan_2{(s, r)} + \frac{\pi}{2}. $$
* The linear distance $d_3$ is found as 
$$ d_3 = \sqrt{r^2 + s^2} = \sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2 + (z_c -d_1)^2}. $$
* Thus, we obtain two solutions to the inverse position kinematics as long as
the wrist center does not intersect $\bm{z}_0$.

* If $x_c = y_c = 0$ the configuration is singular and $\theta_1$ can take any
value.
* If there is an offset $d \neq 0$ as shown, then the wrist center cannot
intersect $\bm{z}_0$.
  - In this case, we will have $d_2 = d$ or $d_3 = d$ and there will, in
    general, be only two solutions for $\theta_1$.

## Inverse orientation {.smaller}

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* The inverse orientation problem is one of finding the values of the final
three joint variables corresponding to a given orientation w.r.t. the frame
$\Sigma_3$.

* For a spherical wrist, this can be interpreted as the problem of finding a set
of Euler angles corresponding to a given rotation matrix $\bm{R}$.

* We can therefore use the method developed all the way back in your youth, in
Chapter 02, to solve for the three Euler angles $\phi$, $\theta$, $\psi$, and
then use the mapping 

$$ 
\phi \mapsto \theta_4, \;\; \theta \mapsto \theta_5, \;\; \psi \mapsto \theta_6.
$$

& 0
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
* The matrix ${^3}\bm{R}_6$ comes from the product $\bm{A}_4\bm{A}_5\bm{A}_6$:

$$
{^3}\bm{R}_6 = \begin{pmatrix}
c_4c_5c_6 - s_4s_6 & -c_4c_5s_6 - s_4c_6 & c_4s_5 \\

$$ \theta_5 = \arctan_2{\left( \pm \sqrt{1 - (s_1r_{13} - c_1r_{23})^2},
s_1r_{13} - c_1r_{23} \right)}. $$

* If the positive square root is chosen in this equation, then $\theta_4$ and
$\theta_6$ are given as 
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \theta_4 &= \arctan_2{(-c_1s_{23}r_{13}-s_1s_{23}r_{23}+c_{23}r_{33}, c_1c_{23}r_{13} + s_1c_{23}r_{23} + s_{23}r_{33})}, \\
    \theta_6 &= \arctan_2{(s_1r_{12} - c_1r_{22}, -s_1r_{11}+c_1r_{21})}.
\end{aligned}
$$

* The other solutions are obtained analogously.
* If $s_5 = 0$, then the joint axes $\bm{z}_3$ and $\bm{z}_5$ are collinear.
* This is a singular configuration and in this case only the sum $\theta_4 + \theta_6$ can be
determined.
* One solution is to choose $\theta_4$ arbitrarily and then determine $\theta_6$.

* The inverse kinematics solution is given as the set of solutions to the
equation

$$
\bm{T}_4^0 = \begin{pmatrix}
\bm{R} & \bm{o} \\ 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
    c_{12}c_4 + s_{12}s_4 & s_{12}c_4 - c_{12}s_4 & 0 & a_1c_1 + a_2c_{12} \\

    0 & 0 & -1 & -d_3-d_4 \\ 
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

* Since SCARA has only four-DoF, a solution of this equation does not exist for 
all $\bm{H} \in \bm{SE}(3)$.
  - In fact, we can easily see that there is no solution unless $\bm{R}$ is of 
  the form
* If this is the case, we must have:

* Projecting the manipulator configuration onto the $\bm{x}_0-\bm{y}_0$-plane
yields the geometry shown in the figure. Using law of cosines,
$$
c_2 = \frac{o_x^2 + o_y^2 - a_1^2 -a_2^2}{2a_1a_2} \; \Longrightarrow
        \; \theta_2 = \arctan_2{\left( \pm \sqrt{1 - c_2^2}, c_2 \right)}.
$$

* The values of $\theta_1$ and $\theta_4$ are then obtained as

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \theta_1 &= \arctan_2{(o_y, o_x)} - \arctan_2{(a_2s_2, a_1 + a_2c_2)}, \\
    \theta_4 &= \theta_1 + \theta_2 - \alpha = \theta_1 + \theta_2 - \arctan_2{(r_{12}, r_{11})}.
\end{aligned}

* Finally, $d_3$ is given by

$$
d_3 = d_1 - o_z - d_4.
